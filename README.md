# Homebrew Ruff

This tap contains Ruff formulae for the Homebrew package manager.

## How do I install these formulae?

Just `brew tap ruffjs/ruff` and then `brew install ruff`.

If the formula conflicts with one from Homebrew/homebrew or another tap, you can `brew install homebrew/tex/ruff`.

You can also install via URL:

```
brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ruffjs/homebrew-ruff/master/<formula>.rb
```
